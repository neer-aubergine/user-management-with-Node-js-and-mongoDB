You can test the backend by hitting the API endpoints on the live demo link above. Here are some example endpoints you can use:

| **Action**       | **Method** | **Endpoint**            |
|------------------|------------|-------------------------|
| Create User      | POST       | `/api/add-user`         |
| Delete User      | DELETE     | `/api/users/:id`        |
| Update User      | PUT        | `/api/users/:id`        |
| Get User         | GET        | `/api/users/:id`        |
